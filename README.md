Text message solution for when cellular service is not availible using Lora RF


This project was created to bring walkie talkies to the new age of technology. The idea behind this was to make a portable device that can interface with a smartphone to act as a method to send messages back and forth when cellular service is not an option. It is baised on the popular RF technology Lora. Using low power broad spectrum transmission, this device is able to transmit and recieve over a long distance without consuming a lot of battery power. That makes it ideal for this project. 

The current interface to the device is over bluetooth and through an Android app. 
This project is stil very much in development and is not working as of yet.
